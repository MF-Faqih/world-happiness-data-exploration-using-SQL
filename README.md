# world-happiness-data-exploration-using-SQL

In this project, I'm using SQL to do data exploration on World Happiness Report from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021/data)

- What's the usage of the data?
  This data can be used for anyone who want to see any factor that gave influence to ladder score (happiness index), also to give better understanding about the state of the people in a country based on each foctor value

- Further benefit
  This project may help policy maker to make better decision in every policy to increase happiness index of the population in their country
